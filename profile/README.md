## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to JS Heaven. We focus on writing great opensource JavaScript/TypeScript packages and libraries. To keep complexity low, each package published here serves only one purpose at a time. We pay close attention to elegant architecture, high standards in software development such as good performance, low footprint, security  and extensive test coverage, as well as well-written documentation, automated CI workflows and active maintenance.

We hope you enjoy our open source software which we have created with great attention to detail. If you are happy with what you see, feel free to support us in any way.
