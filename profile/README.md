## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to JS Heaven. We focus on writing great JavaScript/TypeScript packages and libraries. Each package published here serves a specific purpose. We pay attention to elegant architecture, high standards in software development such as good performance, small footprint, well-written documentation and extensive test coverage, automated CI workflows and ongoing maintenance.

We hope you enjoy using our open source software. If you are happy with what you see, feel free to support us in any way.
